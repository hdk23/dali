Problem Set 5 Discussion

File-Driven Testing

Test File
When I ran the test file, I got 31/37 correct, which is one shy of the sample solution, but still pretty accurate.
(I confirmed with another TA that should be good enough.)

The program incorrectly identified words for the following:
COMPARING pro AND det FOR THE WORD the
COMPARING . AND v FOR THE WORD saw
COMPARING det AND p FOR THE WORD to
COMPARING n AND v FOR THE WORD bark
COMPARING det AND p FOR THE WORD to
COMPARING n AND v FOR THE WORD bark

As seen in the data, the program made mistakes for the same words twice for two words.
For the word "bark," bark is used as a noun and a verb in the training data, so there is an ambiguity.
For the word "to," determiners often precede nouns, and the word to was also not found in the training data.
Most of the sentences also started with pronouns instead of determiners in the training data, which may have influenced the test as well.
The . for a verb is a quirk that does not seem to have a particular pattern. It's not perfect after all!

Brown
When I ran the Brown test file, I got 35077/36394 (96.38%) correct, less than 0.1% off from the sample solution's 96.47%.
The longer test file may have made each error count less, explaining the higher accuracy rate.
There are more sentences to use as data.

Console-Driven Testing

Test Case #1: all based on words in the training data but never put together before
Try:  we bark for the trains (pro v p det n .)
6 OUT OF 6
There are no observation penalties in this sentence, so the program could smoothly transfer its knowledge from the training.

Test Case #2: parallel structure to training data
Try: our outfits are fashionable. (pro n v adj .)
5 OUT OF 5
The program is familiar with this progression of words, so

Test Case #3: ambiguous parts of speech
Try: I hate to work on work (pro v p v p n .)
COMPARING pro AND p FOR THE WORD to
COMPARING det AND p FOR THE WORD on
5 OUT OF 7
Surprisingly, this program did not have errors with the word "work" despite the ambiguity.
This sentence had a common error with prepositions like other samples.


Test Case #4: same sentence as test data
Try: the dog saw trains in the night . (DET N V N P DET N .)
COMPARING pro AND det FOR THE WORD the
COMPARING . AND v FOR THE WORD saw
6 OUT OF 8 (same mistakes as file-driven testing)


Test Case #5: multiple sentences
Try: you go to dartmouth . i thought dartmouth students were smarter .

COMPARING det AND p FOR THE WORD to
COMPARING n AND v FOR THE WORD thought
COMPARING v AND n FOR THE WORD dartmouth
COMPARING p AND n FOR THE WORD students
COMPARING det AND v FOR THE WORD were
COMPARING n AND adj FOR THE WORD smarter

6 OUT OF 12
This sentence had more errors because of two consecutive nouns and its general complexity.
Most of the other sentences were still pretty accurate.

Test Case #6: same paragraph as test data
same results as file-driven testing
